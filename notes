Neural Network Tutorial Notes

- a neural network learns through reconfiguration of the weigh assignments for
	inputs to the neurons

 x_n = input N
 w_n = weight N
 
 activation = value tested by the threshold to determine if neuron will fire
 activation = w1x1 + w2x2 + w3x3 + ... + w_n * x_n

 - if activation threshold is satisfied, neuron returns 1
 - otherwise, neuron returns a value of zero
